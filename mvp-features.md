✅ MVP Checklist for MedAssist
Here’s what your MVP must include to deliver actual utility to Canadian doctors or med students:

🧠 1. PubMed-Integrated, Perplexity-Powered Chat
User enters a question (e.g. “What are current treatments for pancreatic cancer?”)

MedAssist uses Perplexity API + PubMed queries to:

Search relevant academic literature

Summarize answers

Show citations with links (PubMed or DOIs)

✅ This is your core differentiator.

📝 2. Citation + Summary Format
Each answer should include:

A concise, readable summary

2–3 clickable references from PubMed or papers

Option to “View Full Study” or “Copy Answer to Notes”

This shows credibility, which doctors require.

📂 3. User Notes / Saved Chats 
Allow users to save a response or tag it as important

Bonus: Let them export to PDF or email

Doctors love taking notes. This will show you’re solving workflow issues.

🔎 4. Smart Search - Done ✅
A search bar that:

Suggests topics (autocomplete)

Offers filters: e.g. "Last 5 years", "RCTs only", etc.

Helps clinicians refine queries fast.

👨‍⚕️ 5. User Persona Selection (Optional But Smart)
Before chatting, let user choose:

🎓 Med Student

🩺 Family Physician

🧪 Researcher

🧠 Specialist (e.g., neurology)

This can help personalize answers, improve trust, and later feed into monetization (tiered features).

🧪 6. Example Questions Section  - Done ✅
Doctors might not know what to ask.
Have a list like:

“What are current Canadian guidelines for managing hypertension?”

“Compare GLP-1 receptor agonists vs insulin for diabetes.”
