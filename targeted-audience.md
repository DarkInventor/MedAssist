Recommended Target Audience
The most promising segment for a new Canadian tool like medassist is primary care providers (family physicians, nurse practitioners, community pediatricians) – especially those in community clinics or rural/underserved areas. Nearly all competitor AI scribe solutions focus on primary care (Infoway’s funding targets family docs and rural nurses

; Pippen and Scribeberry explicitly address busy GPs). Primary care clinicians face huge administrative burdens (94% report burnout from 40%+ of time on admin

) and lack IT support, making them receptive to AI assistants. By contrast, specialists or hospitals often have more resources/IT staff or existing EHR solutions. Tailoring medassist to family practice workflows and Canadian EMRs (Oscar, TELUS, etc.) would meet a clear need. This is supported by WELL Health’s Phelix partnership, which targeted clinics and OSCAR EMR users

. Focusing on community-based primary care teams (including NPs and nurses) allows medassist to leverage local trust and navigate PHIPA/PIPEDA more easily than if aimed solely at large hospital systems.
